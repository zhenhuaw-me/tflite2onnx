`tflite2onnx` converts TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) models (`*.tflite`) to ONNX models (`*.onnx`),
with data layout and quantization semantic properly handled (check the [introduction blog][intro] for detail).

If you'd like to convert a TensorFlow model (frozen graph `*.pb`, `SavedModel`
or whatever) to ONNX, try [`tf2onnx`](https://github.com/onnx/tensorflow-onnx).
Or, you can firstly [convert][tf2tflite] it to a TFLite (`*.tflite`) model,
and then convert the TFLite model to ONNX.


## Call for Contribution

Currently we have [14 open issues](https://github.com/zhenhuaw-me/tflite2onnx/issues).
I am sorry that I don't have more bandwidth to work on them.
*Please help to contribute to this project!* See [Contributing](#contributing) below.

Started from the beginning, I have written [docs](#documentation) to help you ramp up this project.
Therefore I am not the critical path of this project.

Microsoft has implemented another _TensorFlow Lite to ONNX model converter_ in `tf2onnx`
[at Feb 2021](https://github.com/onnx/sigs/blob/master/converters/meetings/019-20210212.md)
(we open sourced `tflite2onnx` in May 2020). `tf2onnx` seems to able to convert Quantization
just like us, and it seems able to convert RNN networks which we are not supported yet.
Yet, due to the architecture, I think it's non-trivial to fix a bug, which means that,
`tflite2onnx` is a rather better choice if you are blocked and don't wait for a fix from the maintainer.


## Installation

Install via [pip][pypi] `pip install tflite2onnx`.

Or install from source to get latest features (please try out with [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io)):

1. Download the repo: `git clone https://github.com/zhenhuaw-me/tflite2onnx.git && cd tflite2onnx`
2. Build the package: `./scripts/build-wheel.sh`
3. Install the built package: `pip install assets/dist/tflite2onnx-*.whl`

Or you can just add the code tree to your `$PYTHONPATH`.
(Command line tool is not avaiable in this mode.)

```sh
export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd):${PYTHONPATH}
```


## Usage

### Python Interface

```py
import tflite2onnx

tflite_path = '/path/to/original/tflite/model'
onnx_path = '/path/to/save/converted/onnx/model'

tflite2onnx.convert(tflite_path, onnx_path)
```

`tflite2onnx` now supports *explicit layout*, check the
[test example](https://github.com/zhenhuaw-me/tflite2onnx/blob/master/tests/test_explicit_layout.py).


### Command Line

```sh
tflite2onnx /path/to/original/tflite/model /path/to/save/converted/onnx/model
```
